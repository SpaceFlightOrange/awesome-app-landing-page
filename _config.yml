marketing_header: AgilePoker - Agile Software Estimation for iOS # Optional
marketing_desc: AgilePoker is a small application that is of use to people who work in an Agile software development environment such as Scrum or Extreme Programming (XP), using story point estimation.

To use simply tap the desired card to show it, and tap again to return to the deck.

Planning Poker® is an interesting and fun way of estimating tasks and gets everybody involved in the process. It also speeds the estimating process up considerably.

How does it work?

Planning Poker® is based on a list of features for a piece of software to be delivered, and a deck of cards.

The deck contains the following cards: 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ? and a coffee break card.

An overview of the task (user story) to be estimated is given.

Each individual selects a card representing their estimate.

Everyone simultaneously turns their cards over.

Any great variance in the estimation is discussed.

The estimation process is repeated until a consensus is reached.
